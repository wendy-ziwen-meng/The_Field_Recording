The Field Recording is an installation that transforms participants' voices into the sounds of humpback whales. By integrating sound processing technologies, this piece offers an immersive dive into the oceanic realm, modulating human vocal expressions into the complex, melodious songs of these marine behemoths. Attendees are invited to interact with the installation by speaking or singing into a specially designed interface, which then artfully adjusts the pitch, timbre, and duration of their voices to mimic the signature calls of humpback whales. This work wim to forge a connection between humanity and the natural world but also serves as a poignant reminder of the need to protect these beautiful creatures and their habitats. The Field Recording stands as a testament to the power of art to inspire conservation and deepen our understanding of the planet's intricate ecosystems.
