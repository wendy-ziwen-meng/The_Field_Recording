The Field Recording is an installation that transforms participants' voices into the sounds of humpback whales. By integrating sound processing and sound visualization technologies through MaxMSP and TouchDesigner, this piece offers an immersive dive into the oceanic realm, modulating human vocal expressions into the mysterious songs of humpback whales. Participants are invited to interact with the installation by speaking or singing into a specially designed interface, which then transform their voices to mimic the signature calls of humpback whales. This project is designed to amplify our empathy towards the ocean's giants through sound. It aims to forge a connection between humanity and the natural world but also serves as a reminder of the need to protect these beautiful creatures and their habitats. 

## Installation Overview

The installation features a MaxMSP user interface alongside a display that presents interactive visuals created with TouchDesigner. Communication between the two software applications is facilitated through the OSC protocol.

Participants are invited to speak or sing into a microphone, where their voices are transformed into the captivating sounds of humpback whales. They have the opportunity to record their unique whale calls using the MaxMSP interface. Further away from them is the display screen, at the bottom part of the screen, a real-time spectrogram reveals which whale call sample was utilized to craft their personalized call, enhancing the interactive and educational aspect of the experience.

## Background and Inspiration
This installation draws inspiration from Cosmo Sheldrake's album "[Wild Wet World](https://www.cosmosheldrake.com/music/wildwetworld)," a collection of music composed entirely of oceanic animal sounds, including the singing of humpback whales and the clicking of sperm whales, among others. This revelation opened my eyes to the profound understanding that aquatic animals are not so different from humans; they too have their unique songs, mirroring our own capacity for musical expression.
The song of the humpback whale particularly captivated me. Humpback whales exhibit highly variable vocalizations, which they arrange into phrases and themes to create songs. These songs evolve over time as whales incorporate new sounds or rearrange phrases. Interestingly, many humpback populations sing different songs, suggesting cultural phenomena within the species. I plan to create an installation that can convert human voices into sequences of various whale calls. This will not only provide an immersive experience but also serve an educational purpose.
