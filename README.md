A short video of "The Field Recording" can be found here.

The Field Recording is an installation that transforms participants' voices into the sounds of humpback whales. By integrating sound processing and sound visualization technologies through MaxMSP and TouchDesigner, this piece offers an immersive dive into the oceanic realm, modulating human vocal expressions into the mysterious songs of humpback whales. Participants are invited to interact with the installation by speaking or singing into a specially designed interface, which then transform their voices to mimic the signature calls of humpback whales. This project is designed to amplify our empathy towards the ocean's giants through sound. It aims to forge a connection between humanity and the natural world but also serves as a reminder of the need to protect these beautiful creatures and their habitats.
